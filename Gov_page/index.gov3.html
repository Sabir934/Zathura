                    </b>
                    <p>The provisional allocation of the selected candidate is announced on the official website. The IBPS Banks are allocated as per candidates' preference which is given during online application.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>BPS does its share in the selection process up to the provisional allotment to various banks only. Once the provisional allotment is made to the various banks, it becomes the job of the concerned banks to intimate the selected candidates for their joining date and procedures.

                        Public Sector Banking has emerged as a glorious career choice in present times since it is associated with the assurance of good salary, benefits, security of job, quick promotion and healthy work-life balance. India government had established Personnel Selection Services (PSS) in 1975 to make recruitment of clerks and probationary officers into all public sector banks. Subsequently, it was renamed Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS) in 1984 according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandate.</p><br>
